ERROR:1000 | looks like you tried to feed a parameter sequence (array) to a function that only accepts a single number as a parameter | scope:interpreter.calculations
ERROR:1001 | only number sequences (arrays) are allowed in this context	| scope:interpreter.evaluations
ERROR:1002 | not correct number of params	| scope:interpreter.calculations







RECURSION VIOLATION PRICIPLE:
production-node
	production-value-1
	|production-value-2 production-value-3

here "production-value-1" cannot be found above (or precedent to) "production-node", if so we get inifinite recursion
"production-value-3" is ok as it can be found above as long as "production-value-2" is not. this si due to the fact that "production-value-2" is a gate to "production-value-3".





	----------------------------------- more notes -----------------------------------
	We have 3 types of functions
	(1) paramless
	(2) single value
	(3) parameterized
	eventually we only want to keep #1 & #3


	----------------------------------- Objects -----------------------------------
	Functions need a meta language

	Result:
		Value
		StringValue
		Visual
		JsonObject (custom object)



TODO NOTES:
Clean up the ihp and move it to the "Helpers" namespace.
Remove any hardcoded strings or triggers from th ihp.
remove number_1 and number_2 stuff and consolidate.
add external arrays
add array-functions
change result sets to use "[]" instead of "{}"
